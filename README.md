This repository has the instructions about running analysis on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

Dataset: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones in https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

File: CodeBook.md is a code book which describes the data

Code: It is described in run_analysis.R and contains:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
